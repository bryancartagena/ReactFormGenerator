# React Form Generator

A modern, flexible form generation system built with React and TypeScript that allows for dynamic creation of complex forms with various input types including text fields, checkboxes, file uploads, and a custom PillList component.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Generation**: Create forms from JSON configurations
- **Multiple Input Types**: Support for various input types including:
  - Text inputs
  - Text areas
  - Checkboxes
  - Radio buttons
  - Select dropdowns
  - File uploads with progress indicators
  - Custom PillList component for tag-like inputs
- **Form Validation**: Built-in validation for required fields and custom validation rules
- **Loading Indicators**: Visual feedback during form submission
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface using Tailwind CSS
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety throughout the application

## PillList Component

One of the key features is the custom PillList component that allows users to:
- Add new pills by typing text and pressing Enter or clicking the Add button
- Display pills as rounded labels with text
- Remove pills by clicking the Ã— button on each pill
- Store the pills as an array in the form data

## Technologies Used

- **React**: UI library for building the component interface
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **React Hot Toast**: For toast notifications
- **Context API**: For global state management (loading spinner)
